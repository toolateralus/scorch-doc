the general data structure of the program probably has many severe deficiencies due to our lack of understanding of rust: 
if we can, we want it to be possible to stack allocate structs, values, functions, etc, and then have optional heap allocation.
right now, we're fully heap allocated for the most part, mostly due to struggles in designing the backend and using rust.
I think we can replace quite a few usages of Box<> and Rc<RefCell<>> with lifetime specifiers and & references, which I think is how wec can achieve this goal.
