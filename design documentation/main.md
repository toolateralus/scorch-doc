# Scorch Lang : Design

## Note: this language is not publicly available.

## Goals:
- create a C#/JavaScript like language with lower level features / constructs & significantly better performance.
- probably offer a much more compiled language that's less dynamic, or a bytecode jit / runtime lang that is about as dynamic as javascript.
